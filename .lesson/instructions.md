# Exercise 4.2 - Multiplication Facts

In this assignment, you will create a program that prints the multiplication facts for a number.

## Requirements

Write a program that asks for an integer (called the multiplicand) and the number of multiplication facts they want.  The program should print that many multiplication facts for the multiplicand (see sample below).

**Sample Execution #1**

```
Enter an integer: 7
How many facts do you want? 10

1 x 7 = 7
2 x 7 = 14
3 x 7 = 21
4 x 7 = 28
5 x 7 = 35
6 x 7 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 7 = 56
9 x 7 = 63
10 x 7 = 70
```

## Submitting

When you are finished, push your code to GitHub.  Submit it on [Gradescope](gradescope.com) where it will be graded:
* Correctness - 80% (automatic)
* Style - 20% (manual - see [Style Guide](https://mrdevet.github.io/ICS3C/assignments/Style-Guide/))
